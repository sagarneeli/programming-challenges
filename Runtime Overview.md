## O(log(N))
- log(N) grows VERY slowly. 
- log(1,000,000) is only about 20. Example many mainstream relational databases such as postgres use B-trees for indexing by default, and search in B-tree is log(N)).
- In coding interviews, log(N) typically means
  - Binary search or variant
  - Balanced binary search tree lookup
